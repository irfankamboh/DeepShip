# DeepShip
keeping in view the limitation of file size and space on github directory, a part of dataset could be uploaded on this repository. The remaining part can be downloaded by

DeepShip offers an opportunity to train and evaluate the performance of different algorithms, and to identify their strengths and weakness. The advantage of this dataset is that
it is recorded in the real world sea environment in different seasons and sea conditions. Along with vessels signals, recorded signals also have natural background noise, marine
mammal noise and noise of any other human initiated activity. This dataset consists of 47 hours and 04 minutes of real world underwater recordings of 265 different ships belong
to four classes. Data for four commercial ship classes is provided. These classes include oil tanker, tug, passenger ship and cargo ship. Moreover,
mechanism of collection of data and its labeling are also discussed. We hope that availability of a good benchmark data set will promote and accelerate the research and
development in this field. 
Data recording is done in duration between 02 May 2016 to 04 October 2018 in strait of Georgia delta node. Figure 2 illustrates the over all setup for recording of vessel audio.
